            <strong>synchronicity</strong> is an offline hackathon in which
            participants can sharpen their skills and connect with people to
            grow together. It is designed to spark innovation, attract and
            educate new talent and create new channels for collaboration between
            performance and capacity professionals. We want to spread the idea
            that programming is a useful skill that can be enjoyed by anyone. We
            are planning to host approximately 150+ students offline in the
            college with proper arrangement and 200+ students online.
