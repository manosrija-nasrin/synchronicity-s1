# synchronicity - season 1

**synchronicity** is an offline hackathon organized by [Jadavpur University ACM Student Chapter](https://acm-student-chapter-website.vercel.app/). This repository contains the code for the [website](https://synchronicity.vercel.app/).

## Overview

The project is coded using React.js and made with effort! ðŸ§¡

## Setup

- Make sure you have Git Bash installed on your machine. See [here](git-scm.com).
- Fork the repository to have your own copy to work on. This is optional if you don't want to contribute to the project but it's always a good practice.
- Clone the repository locally using `git clone <REPO_LINK>`.
- Run `npm install` in your terminal. This will install the dependencies.
- Then enter `npm run dev` in your terminal and click the live server link that appears. (Usually localhost:5173)
- You're done! Watch the website in action!

## Contributing

To contribute, follow the steps in the setup. Fork, clone, change, run the project.

- Create a new development branch to test out new features before adding them so you don't break the website.
- Make sure to commit small batch of changes with descriptive messages.
- Always test your changes before committing. In this case, simply check that your change(s) didn't break the website (!!)
- Create a new pull request and wait for review by the maintainers!

If your PR is accepted, congratulations! If not, the reviewer will have given some reason for that. Make corrections if you can. Repeat!
